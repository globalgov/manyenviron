# CIESIN Preparation Script

# This is a template for importing, cleaning, and exporting data
# ready for the many packages universe.

# Stage one: Collecting data
CIESIN <- readxl::read_excel("data-raw/agreements/CIESIN/CIESIN.xls")

# Stage two: Correcting data
# In this stage you will want to correct the variable names and
# formats of the 'CIESIN' object until the object created
# below (in stage three) passes all the tests.
CIESIN <- as_tibble(CIESIN) %>%
  manydata::transmutate(Title = manypkgs::standardise_titles(`Treaty Title`),# Key API has been used here
                     # to translate treaties title to English
                     Signature = manypkgs::standardise_dates(`Year of Agreement`),
                     Force = manypkgs::standardise_dates(`Year of Entry into Force`)) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(Beg = dplyr::coalesce(Signature, Force)) %>%
  dplyr::select(Title, Beg, Signature, Force) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(Beg)

# Add treaty_ID column
CIESIN$treaty_ID <- manypkgs::code_agreements(CIESIN, CIESIN$Title, CIESIN$Beg)

# Add many_ID column
many_ID <- manypkgs::condense_agreements(manyenviron::agreements)
CIESIN <- dplyr::left_join(CIESIN, many_ID, by = "treaty_ID")

# Re-order the columns
CIESIN <- CIESIN %>% 
  dplyr::select(many_ID, Title, Beg, Signature, Force, treaty_ID) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(Beg)

# manypkgs includes several functions that should help cleaning
# and standardising your data.
# Please see the vignettes or website for more details.

# Stage three: Connecting data
# Next run the following line to make CIESIN available
# within the package.
manypkgs::export_data(CIESIN, database = "agreements", URL = "https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/entri/")
# can not export yet as standardise_dates() do not function on dates range

# This function also does two additional things.
# First, it creates a set of tests for this object to ensure adherence
# to certain standards.You can hit Cmd-Shift-T (Mac) or Ctrl-Shift-T (Windows)
# to run these tests locally at any point.
# Any test failures should be pretty self-explanatory and may require
# you to return to stage two and further clean, standardise, or wrangle
#Â your data into the expected format.
# Second, it also creates a documentation file for you to fill in.
# Please make sure that you cite any sources appropriately and fill in as
# much detail about the variables etc as possible.
