OTTAWA, April 18, 1975

His Excellency Asbjorn Skarstein
Ambassador of Norway
Ottawa

Excellency,

I have the honour to refer to the Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of Norway on Sealing and the Conservation of Seal Stocks in the Northwest Atlantic, done at Ottawa on July 15, 1971, which entered into force on December 22, 1971.

In accordance with arrangements discussed during a meeting of representatives of our two Governments, held in Bergen on February 27, 1975, I have the honour to propose on behalf of the Government of Canada that, notwithstanding the terms of the Canada / Norway Sealing Agreement, Norwegian vessels shall be allowed to take seals (including hooded seals):

    a. within the outer nine miles of the territorial sea on the Atlantic coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador between 48°00’ North latitude and 55°20’ North latitude; and
    b. outside a line drawn between Gull Island 50°00’0l” North, 55°21’15” West and Turr Islet 49°50’11” North and 54°08’45” West, but not closer than three miles from the nearest land; and
    c. inside the Strait of Belle Isle up to a line joining Barge Point and Cape Norman Light, but not closer than five miles from the nearest land off Newfoundland, between Cape Norman and Cape Bauld, and not closer than three miles from the nearest land between Barge Point and Double Island, and including Belle Isle; and
    d. up to three miles from the nearest land between Double Island 52º15’30” North 55°32’58” West, and Outer Gannet Island 54°00’00” North 56º32’12” West; and
    e. up to but not inside the baseline between Outer Gannet Island 54°00’00” North 56º32’12” West and East Rock (White Bear) 54°27’06” North and 56°51’08” West.

If the foregoing proposals are acceptable to your Government I have the honour to propose that this Note which is authentic in English and French, and your Excellency’s reply to that effect, shall constitute an agreement between our two governments to apply for the 1975 sealing season the measures indicated in the previous paragraph, and to propose that such agreement shall enter into force on the date of your reply, with effect from March 15, 1975.

Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.

Acting Secretary of State for External Affairs
