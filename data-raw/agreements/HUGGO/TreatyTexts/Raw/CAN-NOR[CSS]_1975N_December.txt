The Secretary of State for External Affairs of Canada to the Ambassador of Norway

Ottawa, December 8, 1975

No. FLA-738

His Excellency Knut Hedemann
Ambassador of Norway
Ottawa

Excellency,

I have the honour to refer to the Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of Norway on Sealing and the Conservation of Seal Stocks in the Northwest Atlantic, done at Ottawa on July 15, 1971, which entered into force on December 22, 1971.

In accordance with arrangements discussed during the fourth meeting of the Canada-Norway Sealing Commission held at Edinburgh, Scotland on June 9, 1975, I have the honour to propose on behalf of the Government of Canada that Articles II and XII of the Canada-Norway Sealing Agreement be amended to read as follows:
ARTICLE II

“This agreement applies to harp seal (Phoca groenlandica), hooded seal (Cystophora cristata), bearded seal (Erignatus Barbatus) and walrus (Odobe­nus rosmarus).”
ARTICLE XII

“Subject to the provisions of this agreement, Norwegian vessels engaged in sealing operations are allowed, notwithstanding the provisions of the Exchange of Notes between the Government of Canada and the Government of Norway of July 15, 1971, constituting an Agreement with Respect to Norwegian Fishing Practices off the Atlantic Coast of Canada, to take seals:

    a. within the outer nine miles of the territorial sea on the Atlantic coast of Canada between 48°00’ North latitude and 55°20’ North latitude; and
    b. outside a line drawn between Gull Island 50°00’01" North, 55°21’15’ West, and Turr Islet 49°50’ll” North and 54°08’45” West, but not closer than three miles from the nearest land; and
    c. inside the Strait of Belle Isle up to a line joining Barge Point and Cape Norman Light, but not closer than five miles from the nearest land off Newfoundland between Cape Norman and Cape Bauld, and not closer than three miles from the nearest land between Barge Point and Double Island, including Belle Isle; and
    d. up to three miles from the nearest land between Double Island 52°15’30” North, 55°32’58” West, and Outer Gannet Island 54°00’00” North, 56°31’12” West; and
    e. up to but not inside the baseline between Outer Gannet Island 54°00’00’ North, 56°32’12” West and East Rock (White Bear) 54°27’06” North and 56°32’12” West.

Norwegian sealing is not otherwise allowed in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.”

If the foregoing proposals are acceptable to your Government I have the honour to propose that this Note, the English and French versions of which are equally authentic, and your Excellency’s reply in Norwegian to that effect shall constitute an Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of Norway which shall enter into force on the date of your reply.
