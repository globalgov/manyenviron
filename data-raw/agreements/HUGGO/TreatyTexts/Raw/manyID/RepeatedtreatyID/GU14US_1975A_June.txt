as the data supplied at the May, 1975, meeting between the two Governments;
b. To the extent possible, meetings of scientists of both countries as well as the
participation of the scientists of one country in fishery research conducted by the
vessels of the other country; and
c. A cooperative program through which the fisheries specialists of one coun
try shall be placed aboard fishing vessels of the other country for the purpose of ob
taining biostatistical data from catches obtained by using various fishing methods.
3. The Government of the Polish People's Republic will ensure the collection
of biostatistical data on the total catch (including by-catch) of all species by
30 minute square graticules, by vessel class, on a haul-by-haul basis, for fisheries
covered by this Agreement, and the provision of such data to the appropriate
fisheries authorities of the United States Government on a monthly basis.
4. Each Government shall take the appropriate steps to assure cooperation
among appropriate institutions in the field of fishery research.
Article 2. Both Governments will take measures to assure that their citizens
and vessels will, in the waters covered by this Agreement, conduct their fishing with
due regard for the conservation of the stocks of fish.
Article 3. The Government of the Polish People's Republic will adopt the
measures necessary to ensure that nationals and vessels of Poland will:
a. Refrain from fishing in the Bering Sea east of the International Date Line

North Latitude.
/. Limit the catch of Pacific hake in 1975 throughout the Northeastern Pacific
Ocean to a level not to exceed that taken by Poland in this area in 1974.
Article 4. Recognizing that some incidental catch of living resources of the
continental shelf is unavoidable in directed fisheries for other species when fishing
with gear operated in contact with the bottom, the Government of the Polish
People's Republic, in order to protect and conserve the living resources of the United
States Continental Shelf, agrees to take appropriate measures to:
a. Ensure that its nationals and vessels will:
(1) Refrain from engaging in a directed fishery for any species of living
resources of the United States Continental Shelf on or under the seabed or in waters
above the Continental Shelf of the United States. A list setting forth the living
resources of the United States Continental Shelf shall be provided to the Government
of the Polish People's Republic by the Government of the United States of America.
Such list may be amended if necessary during the period of force of the Agreement;
(2) When engaged in fishing or in fishing support activities in waters over the
Continental Shelf of the United States, refrain from having on board any continental
shelf fishery resources taken on the continental shelf of another country;
(3) Avoid concentrations of living resources of the continental shelf and, when
a concentration of such resources is encountered in the course of their fishing opera
tions, take immediate steps to avoid the concentration in future tows;
(4) When any incidental catch of living resources of the continental shelf is
taken, immediately return those resources to the sea with a minimum of injury. The
amount, species, position, dates, type of gear, time gear on bottom, and disposition
of such incidental catch will be promptly recorded in the vessel's fishing log book;
(5) Allow and assist the boarding and inspection of their vessels using fishing
gear being towed in contact with the bottom by enforcement officers of the United
States for the purpose of ascertaining compliance with this agreement;
b. Reduce the use by its nationals and vessels of fishing gear operated in con
tact with the bottom in fisheries off the coast of the United States, and ensure the
substitution of such gear with gear which does not generally come into contact with
the bottom in normal use;
c. Collect data on the incidental catch and disposition of the living resources
of the continental shelf of the United States by its nationals and vessels, by 30 minute
square graticules, by vessel class, on a haul-by-haul basis. Such information shall be
provided to the Director of the Northwest Region of the United States National
Marine Fisheries Service during the meetings provided for in Article 6 of this Agree
ment.
Article 5. The Government of the United States of America and the Govern
ment of the Polish People's Republic will take steps to minimize the possibility of
conflict between gear anchored in the sea and mobile fishing gear and to investigate
conflicts when they are reported. This will include:
a. For the American side, with respect to fixed fishing gear, development and
use of improved marking and deployment practices, and to the extent possible timely
notification of known locations of concentrations of fixed fishing gear by transmis
sion of radio messages to the Polish fleet.
b. For the Polish side:
(1) Notice to American authorities of areas of concentration of the Polish
fishing fleet in the vicinity of locations of fixed gear. This notification shall be ac
complished in the form of a timely response to the fixed gear notification by
American authorities and shall include current locations of the Polish fleet as well as
inspection vessels.
(2) Acknowledgement of receipt of the fixed fishing gear notifications des
cribed in subparagraph (a) above.
(3) Additional precautionary measures by Polish vessels to avoid fishing
operations that could damage the fixed gear set by United States fishermen engaged
in a specialized fishery for the living resources of the continental shelf, including the
requirement that Polish vessels at all times remain a reasonable distance away from
fixed gear areas to prevent damage to fixed gear and interference with the setting or
hauling of such gear.
c. For both sides:
(1) If a vessel is operating near a fixed gear area in such a manner as to indicate
to competent authorities of either country that a conflict is likely to occur, the abovementioned
authorities shall, with a view to facilitating flag State corrective action,
take prompt steps to prevent the potential conflict. This will include, where possible,
communicating information and warnings concerning the potential danger to the
vessels involved and to any inspector of the other Government known to be [in] the
vicinity or a designated authority of the other Government. Upon receiving such
communications, the authorities shall promptly take appropriate action to attempt
to avoid the occurrence of a conflict. The vessels involved should also communicate
directly using the customary international radio communication procedures;
(2) When a conflict has occurred, either side shall immediately notify the ap
propriate authorities of the other side. Both sides shall ensure that prompt and
thorough investigations are made by appropriate inspectors for their own side. These
investigations should be made on the site of the incident when possible. On a volun
tary basis, the investigation may be conducted jointly by inspectors of both sides.
The invitation to the inspector of the other side will be extended by the inspector of
the flag State upon the request of the master in charge of the fishing vessel involved
in the conflict. The results of these investigations shall be provided to the United
States-Polish Fisheries Board, in accordance with Article 9, for use in case of a claim
arising out of the conflict.
d. United States fishery authorities and Polish fishery authorities will inform
each other of the location of items of fishing gear or other materials lost overboard
which constitute a danger to fishing operations on common fishing grounds.
e. The detailed provisions and procedures of Annex II shall be followed to the
extent possible in implementing the provisions of this Article.
Article 6. 1. Both Governments consider it useful to arrange:
a. Regular visits of representatives of the fisheries authorities of the two coun
tries to exchange information and discuss actual or potential problems concerning
the fishing grounds, questions relating to the operations of the fishing fleets, and
questions arising out of the application of the provisions of this Agreement; such
visits shall take place at the request of either side, and shall occur on appropriate
vessels of either side or at another mutually agreed location.
b. Mutual visits of representatives of fishermen's organizations of the two
countries on vessels operating in the Northeastern Pacific or at another mutually
agreed location.
2. Those participating in each visit shall prepare a brief report of their visit in
each case and submit it to the appropriate authorities of the two Governments. Visits
shall be arranged between the appropriate Regional Director of the National Marine
Fisheries Service in Seattle, Washington; Juneau, Alaska; or Terminal Island,
California, and the chiefs of the fishing fleets of the Deep Sea Fisheries and Fishery
Services Enterprise "DALMOR" in Gdynia, "ODRA" in Swinoujscie, or "GRYF" in
Szczecin, as appropriate. Each side will inform the other side, at least two weeks
before the visit, of subjects it wishes discussed.
3. To facilitate communications for the purposes of this Agreement, each side
shall keep the other advised of the name and radio address of the appropriate of
ficials available in the Agreement area.
Article 7. The areas where Polish fishing vessels may conduct loading opera
tions in the waters of the nine-mile fishery zone contiguous to the territorial sea of the
United States of America shall be as follows:
a. near Forre.ster Island, Alaska, in the waters bounded on the north by 54&#186;54'
North Latitude, on the east by 133&#186; 16' West Longitude, and on the south by
54&#186;44' North Latitude;
b. near Destruction Island, Washington, in the waters between 47&#186;36' North
Latitude and 47&#186;45' North Latitude.
Article 8. The provisions of Annex I shall be applicable, on a voluntary basis,
for the purpose of ensuring the application of the Agreement, except where enforce
ment is otherwise provided for in the Agreement.
Article 9. Both Governments agree that the activities of the nationals and
vessels of the parties to this Agreement shall come within the purview of the United
States-Polish Fisheries Board, established by the Agreement between the Govern
ment of the United States of America and the Government of the Polish People's
Republic Regarding Fisheries in the Western Region of the Middle Atlantic Ocean'
and Annex I thereto, in accordance with the terms of said Annex.
Article 10. Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as prejudicing the
views of either Government with regard to the principle of freedom of fishing on the
high seas.
Article 11. The present Agreement shall enter into force on June 15, 1975 and
shall remain in force through December 31, 1975. At the request of either Govern
ment, representatives of the two Governments will meet at a mutually convenient
time at any time during the period of the Agreement with a view to modifying the
present Agreement or any Annex thereto. In any event, representatives of the two
Governments will meet at a mutually convenient time prior to the expiration of the
period of validity of this Agreement to review its operation and to decide on future
arrangements. Notwithstanding the above, at any time either Government may com
municate to the other Government its intention to denounce the present Agreement,
in which case the Agreement shall terminate one month from the date on the com
munication. As soon as possible after receipt of such communication, represen
tatives of the two Governments will meet to discuss possible future arrangements. An
Annex may be terminated in the same manner during the life of the Agreement
without prejudice to the operation of the Agreement.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF the undersigned, being duly authorized for this purpose,
have signed this Agreement.

ANNEX I
SCHEME OF JOINT ENFORCEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA AND THE POLISH PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC REGARDING FISHERIES IN
THE NORTHEASTERN PART OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN
Pursuant to Article 8 of the Agreement, the following are voluntary arrangements for a
joint enforcement scheme for the purpose of ensuring the application of the Agreement.
1. Control shall be carried out by inspectors of the fishery control services of the two
Governments.
2. The ships used to carry the inspection officers may be either special inspection vessels
or fishing vessels. Notification of the names of the ships and the inspectors shall be provided on
a timely basis to the following officials: in the case of the United States, the Regional Directors
of the Southwest, Northwest, and Alaska Regions of the National Marine Fisheries Service, as
appropriate, through Coast Guard radio stations San Francisco (NMC) or Kodiak (NOJ) and,
in the case of Poland, the chiefs of the Polish fishing fleet.
3. Each inspector shall carry a document of identity supplied by the authorities of his
Government stating that he is a member of a fishery control service of his Government.
4. A ship carrying an inspector may give the signal from the International Code of
Signals requesting permission to come aboard any vessel of the other country engaged for the
time being in fishing or in fish processing in the area covered by the Agreement. The vessel to
be boarded shall not be required to stop or maneuver when fishing, shooting or hauling; the
master shall nonetheless provide a boarding ladder and otherwise observe the ordinary practice
of good seamanship to enable an inspection party coming alongside to board as soon as prac
ticable.
5. On boarding the vessel, an inspector shall produce the document of identity described
above. Inspections shall be made so that the vessel suffers minimum interference and inconve
nience. An inspector shall limit his inquiries to the ascertainment of the facts in relation to the
observance of the Agreement. The master shall enable the inspector to examine and photograph
catch, nets, or other gear and any relevant documents as the inspector deems necessary to
verify the vessel's compliance with the provisions of the Agreement. The inspector shall draw
up a report of his inspection using the attached form. Inspectors will be furnished with the at
tached questionnaire in both the English and Polish languages. The inspector shall sign the
report in the presence of the master of the vessel, who shall be entitled to add or have added to
the report any observations. The master must sign such observations. Copies of the report shall
be given to the master of the vessel and to the inspector's Government which shall transmit
copies to the appropriate authorities of the flag State of the vessel.
6. a. Where an apparent infringement of the provisions of this Agreement is observed,
the inspector shall enter a notation in the fishing log book or other relevant document aboard
the inspected vessel stating the date, location and type of apparent infringement. If
photographs of the vessel, gear, catch and logs or other documents are taken, copies of the
photographs shall be attached to the copy of the report to the flag State. The inspector may,
with a view toward ensuring that the provisions of this Agreement are carried out, immediately
attempt to communicate with the authorities of the flag State designated in paragraph 2 above.
The master of the inspected vessel shall arrange for messages to be sent and received using his
radio equipment and operator for this purpose. If the inspector succeeds in establishing com
munications with the appropriate authorities of the flag State, and providing the designated
authority agrees, the inspector may remain aboard the inspected vessel to facilitate preserva
tion of the evidence of the apparent infringement until boarding of the vessel by an inspector or
other authority of a fishery control service of the flag State or until such other time as may be
agreed.
b. If an inspector is unable to communicate with the appropriate authorities within a
reasonable period of time, he shall complete the inspection, leave the inspected vessel and com
municate as soon as possible with those authorities.
7. Inspectors shall carry out their duties under these arrangements in accordance with
the rules set out in this Annex, but they shall remain under the operational control of their na
tional authorities and shall be responsible to them.
8. The inspector may, subject to any limitations that are imposed by both Governments
jointly, carry out such examination of the catch and fishing gear as he deems necessary to
establish whether or not the Agreement is being complied with. He shall report his finding to
the authorities of the flag State of the inspected vessel as soon as possible.
The inspection of fish and fishing gear may be carried out on and below the fishing decks
of vessels of each country.
9. Each Government shall consider and act on reports of foreign inspectors under these
arrangements on the same basis as reports of national inspectors. The provisions of this
paragraph shall not impose any obligation on either Government to give the report of a foreign
inspector a higher evidential value than it would possess in the inspector's own country. Each
Government shall collaborate in order to facilitate judicial or other proceedings arising from a
report of an inspector under these arrangements.
10. Each Government will inform the other as soon as possible of any actions taken with
respect to fishing violations reported by the other Government.

ANNEX II
MEASURES TO PREVENT FISHING CONFLICT IN THE WATERS
OFF THE COAST OF THE UNITED STATES
1. a. This Annex applies to the waters off the Pacific coast of North America.
b. For purposes of this Annex,
"Fishing vessel" means any vessel engaged in the business of catching fish;
"Vessel" means any fishing vessel and any vessel engaged in the business of processing fish
or providing supplies or services to fishing vessels.
2. a. Fishing vessels shall be registered and marked in order to ensure their proper iden
tification at sea in accordance with the regulations of each Government. The competent
authorities of each Government shall inform the competent authorities of the other Govern
ment of the system of registration and marking used.
b. Each fishing vessel shall carry on board an official document, issued by the competent
authority of its country, showing the name, if any, and description of the vessel, its nationality,
its registration letter or letters and number, and the name of the owner or of the firm or associa
tion to which it belongs.
c. Each fishing vessel shall carry a national flag in good condition to be shown at the re
quest of the competent authorities.
d. The nationality of a fishing vessel shall not be concealed in any manner whatsoever.
3. a. Subject to compliance with the International Regulations for Prevention of Colli
sions at Sea' all vessels shall conduct their operations so as not to interfere with the operations
of fishing vessels, or fishing gear.
b. Vessels arriving on fishing grounds where fishing vessels are already fishing or have
set their gear for that purpose shall inform themselves of the position and extent of gear already
placed in the sea and shall not place themselves or their fishing gear so as to interfere with or
obstruct fishing operations already in progress.
c. No vessel shall anchor or remain on a fishing ground where fishing is in progress if it
would interfere with such fishing unless required for the purpose of its own fishing operations
or in consequence of accident or other circumstances beyond its control.
d. Except in cases of force majeure no vessel shall dump in the sea any article or
substance which may interfere with fishing or obstruct or cause damage to fish, fishing gear or
fishing vessels.
e. No vessel shall use or have on board explosives intended for the catching of fish.
/. In order to prevent damage, fishing vessels engaged in trawling and other fishing
vessels with gear in motion shall take all practicable steps to avoid nets and lines or other gear
which is not being towed.
g. (1) When nets belonging to different fishing vessels get foul of each other, they shall
not be severed without the consent of the parties concerned unless it is impossible to disengage
them by other means.
(2) When fishing vessels fishing with lines entangle their lines, the fishing vessel which
hauls up the lines shall not sever them unless they cannot be disengaged in any other way, in
which case any lines which may be severed shall where possible be immediately joined together
again.
(3) Except in cases of salvage and the cases to which the two preceding subparagraphs
relate, nets, lines or other gear shall not under any pretext whatever, be cut, hooked, held on to
or lifted up except by the fishing vessel to which they belong.
(4) When a vessel fouls or otherwise interferes with gear not belonging to it, it shall take
all necessary measures for reducing to a minimum the injury which may result to such gear. The
fishing vessel to which the gear belongs shall, at the same time, avoid any action tending to ag
gravate such damage.
4. With respect to nets, lines and other gear anchored in the sea, fishing vessels shall
comply with the rules set out below in this paragraph.
a. Fishing vessels operating gear anchored in the sea shall, when they are present, notify
approaching vessels of the position and extent of gear.
b. Fishing vessels using mobile gear shall:
(1) maintain a continuous visual and radar watch for markers indicating the position and ex
tent of gear anchored in the sea;
(2) avoid areas where gear is known to be anchored in the sea.
AGREED MINUTES
1. The representatives of both Governments stated that their Governments
will take appropriate measures to ensure that their nationals and vessels will not, in
trawling for bottom fish, use liners of such mesh size as to retain immature fish. The
Government of the Polish People's Republic will also take appropriate measures to
ensure that its nationals and vessels engaging in the hake fishery will use trawls with a
mesh size, in any of the parts, of no less than 110 millimeters, or 4.33 inches,
stretched mesh, including one knot (two bars).
2. The representatives of both Governments agreed that with respect to para
graph 2, c, of Article 1, the participation of United States fishery scientists aboard
Polish fishing vessels may consist of either duly authorized Federal or State scien
tists.
3. The Polish representative stated that with respect to paragraph h of Arti
cle 3, his Government would provide the United States Government with a list of the
15 Polish vessels which will be licensed to fish in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean, and
further, that there would be no substitutions or additions to the list during the period
of force of the Agreement.
4. Both representatives agreed that when this Agreement is renegotiated,
either upon its termination or prior to termination, the catch level of Pacific hake for
vessels and nationals of Poland will be established at a level based on scientific
evidence concerning the condition of the resource, and that such catch level may be
less than the 1974 level, if considered necessary to conserve the resource.
5. The United States representative took cognizance of the Polish request for
port call privileges along the Pacific coast of the United States, and stated that his
Government would give consideration to the request.
6. The Polish representative stated that the Polish fishing fleet will not con
duct any fishing operations utilizing longline gear.
7. The Polish representative stated that Polish vessels will refrain from fishing
with gear other than pelagic gear in all waters covered by this Agreement, commenc
ing no later than six months from the date of entry into force of this Agreement.
8. The representatives of both Governments agreed that should it be con
sidered desirable to renegotiate or extend this Agreement for 1976, additional
closures and conservation measures necessary to protect the stocks during periods of
the year not covered by this Agreement might be considered and included in any such
extension or modification. The Polish representative agreed that such additional
measures would include, inter alia, the restrictions pertaining to the closed areas in
the Gulf of Alaska included in the current U.S.-Japan fisheries Agreements and
related report.
