MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
CONCERNING CONSERVATION, RESTORATION AND SUSTAINABLE USE OF
THE SAIGA ANTELOPE (Saiga tatarica tatarica)
between
The Forestry and Hunting Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of
Kazakhstan
The Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation
The Ministry of Nature Protection of Turkmenistan
The State Committee for Nature Protection of the Republic of Uzbekistan
The undersigned, acting on behalf of the respective authorities named above,
Assuming international responsibilities to conserve and sustainably use the Saiga antelope
(Saiga tatarica tatarica) pursuant to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)
(Nairobi, 1992), which has recognized migratory species as a unique globally important
component of biodiversity under the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) (Bonn, 1979),
and that CMS is the CBD lead partner in conserving and sustainably using migratory species
over their entire migratory range (Decision VI/20);
Recalling that CMS calls for international cooperative action to conserve migratory species,
and that CMS Article IV, paragraph 4 encourages Contracting Parties to conclude
Agreements - including non-binding administrative agreements such as this one - in respect
of any population of migratory species;
Also recalling CMS Conference of Parties Resolution 6.4 (Strategic Plan for the Convention
on Migratory Species) and operational objective 1.4 (Terrestrial Mammals, other than bats);
Noting that the Saiga antelope is included in Appendix II of the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) (Washington, 1973);
Concerned about unsustainable or illegal domestic and international trade in specimens of
the species;
Aware that the Standing Committee of CITES recommended the development of a regional
conservation strategy for the Saiga antelope;
Aware that the historical range of the Saiga antelope included the vast plains of the Central
Asian and Pre-Caspian region;
2
Recognising that the numbers and the range of the Saiga antelope have declined
considerably in recent decades, and that its unfavourable conservation status is of great
concern in some parts of its current range;
Concerned that poaching and illegal trade in horns and other products, uncontrolled hunting,
destruction of habitats, and construction of irrigation channels, roads and other obstacles
preventing natural dispersion and migration are thought to have contributed to recent
declines of populations of the Saiga antelope, and that economic hardship, impoverishment
of local communities, and poor land use planning are root causes that need to be addressed to
preserve the Saiga antelope;
Noting the need to improve the protection of the Saiga antelope and its habitats within each
Range State and the importance of regional cooperation for its conservation, restoration and
sustainable use, including international trade;
Conscious that coordinated and concerted national and transboundary actions by the
authorities of the Range States responsible for conserving and managing the Saiga antelope,
sub-regional, regional and international organizations, trade and business associations, local
populations, non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders would enhance its
conservation, recovery and sustainable use, and that of the habitats and ecosystems that are
important for its long-term survival;
Acknowledging the shared responsibility towards future generations to conserve, restore and
sustainably use the Saiga antelope and those habitats and ecosystems that are important for
its long-term survival, and the need to undertake national and joint conservation and
management activities;
Confirming that the Range States of the Saiga antelope have the first responsibility to
implement this Memorandum of Understanding; and
Acknowledging that a number of organizations will, within their respective mandates and
capacities, support the implementation of the Action Plan;
AGREE to collaborate to improve the conservation status of the Saiga antelope throughout its
range, and to undertake national and joint activities to conserve, restore and sustainably use
the species and those habitats and ecosystems important for its long-term survival, including
the measures specified in the Action Plan that is annexed to and forms an integral part of this
Memorandum of Understanding.
To this end, and in a spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation, they shall individually
or collectively:
1. Provide effective protection for the Saiga antelope and, where feasible and
appropriate, conserve, restore and sustainably use those habitats and ecosystems that
are important for its long-term survival;
2. Implement the provisions of the Action Plan that shall aim to (a) restore numbers of
the Saiga antelope to ecologically and biologically appropriate levels, (b) restore
range and habitats of Saiga antelope to ecologically and biologically appropriate
3
levels and (c) enhance transboundary and international cooperation through inter alia
a regional conservation and management strategy;
3. Assess regularly the implementation of this Memorandum of Understanding and the
Action Plan. For this purpose, regular meetings can be convened by or in consultation
with the Secretariat of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of
Wild Animals (CMS Secretariat), and hosted by and organized in collaboration with
one of the undersigned Range States or any cooperating organizations;
4. Facilitate the exchange of scientific, technical and legal information to undertake
coordinated measures to conserve, restore and sustainably use Saiga antelope, and
cooperate with other States, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental
organizations and other bodies interested in the implementation of the Memorandum
of Understanding and Action Plan;
5. Designate a competent authority to serve as a focal point for the purpose of
implementing this Memorandum of Understanding, and communicate without delay
the name and contact details of this authority/person (and any changes thereto) to the
CMS Secretariat. For general co-ordination and realization of the Action Plan, the
possibility of establishing an intergovernmental commission for conservation,
restoration and sustainable use of the Saiga antelope and its habitat shall be
considered; and
6. Provide to the CMS Secretariat, within one year of the date of its entry into effect, a
detailed report on the implementation of this Memorandum of Understanding by the
signatory States. The signatory States in consultation with the CMS Secretariat shall
determine the report format. The format will support (a) the informational needs of
the signatory States to effectively implement the Memorandum of Understanding and
(b) the reporting requirements of the Convention on Migratory Species and CITES
where appropriate. The CMS Secretariat shall transmit to each of the Range States
and to cooperating organizations the reports received together with an overview
report, which it shall compile on the basis of information at its disposal.
