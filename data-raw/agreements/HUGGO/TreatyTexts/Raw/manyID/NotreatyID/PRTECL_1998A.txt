Convention on the Protection of the Environment through Criminal Law


Preamble

The member States of the Council of Europe and the other States signatory hereto,
Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity between its members;
Convinced of the need to pursue a common criminal policy aimed at the protection of the environment;
Considering that unregulated industrial development may give rise to a degree of pollution which poses risks to the environment;
Considering that the life and health of human beings, the environmental media and fauna and flora must be protected by all possible means;
Considering that the uncontrolled use of technology and the excessive exploitation of natural resources entail serious environmental hazards which must be overcome by appropriate and concerted measures;
Recognising that, whilst the prevention of the impairment of the environment must be achieved primarily through other measures, criminal law has an important part to play in protecting the environment;
Recalling that environmental violations having serious consequences must be established as criminal offences subject to appropriate sanctions;
Wishing to take effective measures to ensure that the perpetrators of such acts do not escape prosecution and punishment and desirous of fostering international co-operation to this end;
Convinced that imposing criminal or administrative sanctions on legal persons can play an effective role in the prevention of environmental violations and noting the growing international trend in this regard;
Mindful of the existing international conventions which already contain provisions aiming at the protection of the environment through criminal law;
Having regard to the conclusions of the 7th and 17th Conferences of European Ministers of Justice held in Basle in 1972 and in Istanbul in 1990, and to Recommendation 1192 (1992) of the Parliamentary Assembly,
