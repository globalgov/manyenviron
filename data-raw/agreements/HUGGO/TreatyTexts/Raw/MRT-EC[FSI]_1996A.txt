2.4. Failure to comply with the provisions of point 2.1, 2.2 or 2.3 shall entail, irrespective of the penalties laid down by Mauritanian law, automatic suspension of the fishing licence until the shipowner has met such obligations.

3. Fishing log annex

3.1. Masters of vessels shall keep the fishing log annex as shown in the model attached as Appendix 3 to this Annex. The log shall be completed legibly on each landing or transhipment and signed by the master of the vessel.

3.2. At the end of each landing, the shipowner shall send the original of the fishing log annex by mail to the surveillance authorities within a period of no more than 30 days.

3.3. At the end of each authorized transhipment, the shipowner shall immediately send the original of the fishing log annex to the surveillance authorities.

3.4. Failure to comply with the provisions of point 3.1, 3.2 or 3.3 shall entail automatic suspension of the fishing licence until the shipowner has met such obligations.

4. Quarterly catch declarations

4.1. By the end of the third month of each quarter the Commission shall notify the Ministry of the quantities caught in the previous quarter by all Community vessels.

4.2. This information should be broken down by month, by type of fishing, by vessel and by species.

4.3. This system shall be implemented within a period of no more than one and a half years after the entry into force of this Agreement.

5. Reliability of data

The information in the documents referred to in points 1, 2, 3 and 4 above must reflect the actual fishing situation in order to constitute one of the bases for monitoring changes in fishery stocks.

CHAPTER VI By-catches

1. In accordance with Mauritanian law, the percentage of by-catches laid down in the data sheets in the Protocol shall be calculated at any time during fishing according to the total weight of the catch.

2. Should these percentages exceed the authorized by-catches, penalties shall be imposed in accordance with Mauritanian law and may result in the definitive prohibition of the offenders, the masters and the vessels from all fishing activities in Mauritania.

3. The keeping of crawfish on board vessels other than crawfish pot vessels shall be forbidden. Offenders shall be punished in accordance with Mauritanian law.

CHAPTER VII Signing-on of Mauritanian seamen

3. The pay conditions may not be less than those applying to the crews of Mauritanian vessels. The agreed wages shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of the contract of employment.

4. Owners of Community vessels shall ensure the same terms for the signing-on of Mauritanian seamen, officers and trainee officers as those reserved for seamen, officers and trainee officers of other countries.

5. Seamen shall report to the master of the vessel designated on the day before its proposed sailing date. If a seaman fails to report at the time scheduled for its departure, the vessel is authorized to leave the Mauritanian port once in possession of a certificate of absence for the seaman issued by the surveillance authorities.

The shipowner shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the number of seamen required by this Agreement sign on his vessel by the next trip at the latest.

6. Twice a year on 1 January and 1 July shipowners shall send the Ministry a list by vessel of Mauritanian seamen signed on board. Pending receipt of the list, the issue of the licence shall be suspended.

7. Failure to comply with any of the provisions contained in point 1 shall be penalized in accordance with Mauritanian law and may entail the suspension or definitive withdrawal of the licence in case of repeated offending.

CHAPTER VIII Technical inspection

1. Once a year and after any alteration in tonnage or changes to the fishing category necessitating the use of a different type of gear, any Community vessel shall report to the port of Nouadhibou to undergo the inspections required by the legislation in force. Such inspections shall take place within 48 hours of the vessel's putting into port.

By way of derogation from the previous paragraph, the technical inspection procedures applying to tuna vessels and surface longliners fishing for pelagic species shall be laid down in Chapters XII and XIV of this Agreement.

2. When the inspection has been completed, the master of the vessel shall be issued with a certificate. This certificate must be kept on board at all times.

3. The technical inspection shall verify that the vessel's technical characteristics and gear conform to the provisions of the Agreement and that the provisions relating to its Mauritanian crew have been complied with.

4. The cost of the inspection, at the rates laid down by Mauritanian law, shall be borne by the shipowner. It may not be greater than the amount normally paid by other vessels for the same services.

5. Failure by the shipowner to comply with the provisions contained in points 1 and 2 above shall result in automatic suspension of the fishing licence until such obligations have been met.

CHAPTER IX Vessel identification

1. The identification marks of all Community vessels must conform to the relevant Community legislation. The Ministry must be notified of such legislation before this Agreement enters into force. The Ministry must further be notified of any amendment to the legislation at least 30 days before its entry into force.

2. Any vessel attempting to disguise its external identification marks shall be liable to the penalties laid down in the legislation in force.

CHAPTER X Suspension or withdrawal of licences

Where, in application of this Agreement and Mauritanian law, the Mauritanian authorities decide to suspend or withdraw definitively the licence of a Community vessel, the master of that vessel shall cease his fishing activities and make for the port of Nouadhibou. On his arrival at Nouadhibou, he shall send the original of his licence to the competent authorities. Once the required obligations have been duly completed, the Ministry shall notify the Commission of the lifting of the suspension and the licence shall be returned.

CHAPTER XI Other infringements

1. With the exception of the cases specifically provided for in this Agreement, all other infringements shall be penalized in accordance with Mauritanian law.

2. In the event of serious or very serious fisheries infringements as defined by Mauritanian law, the Ministry reserves the right to prohibit the vessels, masters and, where applicable, the shipowners concerned, provisionally or definitively from all fishing activities in Mauritanian waters.

CHAPTER XII Fines

The amount of fines imposed on Community vessels shall be calculated within minimum and maximum limits specified in Mauritanian law. This amount shall be decided in accordance with the procedure laid down in point 3 of Chapter VIII of Annex II.

CHAPTER XIII Provisions relating to vessels fishing highly migratory species (tuna vessels and surface longliners)

1. By way of derogation from the provisions of Chapters I and II of Annex I, licences for tuna seiners shall be issued for a period of 12 months.

The original licence must be kept on board at all times and presented on request of the competent Mauritanian authorities.

However, on receipt of notification of payment of the advance sent to the Mauritanian authorities by the Commission, the vessel shall be entered on a list of vessels authorized to fish, which shall be sent to the Mauritanian authorities responsible for fisheries inspection. A copy of the said licence may be obtained by fax pending arrival of the licence itself; that copy shall be kept on board.

2. Before receiving its licence, each vessel must be presented for the inspections required by the legislation in force. By way of derogation from the provisions of Chapter VIII of this Annex, such inspections may be carried out in a foreign port to be agreed. All expenses linked to such inspection shall be borne by the shipowner.

3. The fee to be paid by the shipowner shall be set at ECU 20 per tonne caught within Mauritania's fishing zone.

4. Licences shall be issued following payment to one of the foreign accounts of the Central Bank of Mauritania, payable to the Tr√©sor de la Mauritanie, of a lump sum corresponding to the advance specified in the data sheets in the Protocol.

5. A logbook in accordance with the ICCAT model in Appendix 4 to this Annex shall be kept on vessels for each fishing period spent in Mauritanian waters. It shall be filled in even when no catches are made.

The words 'Outside Mauritania's EEZ` shall be entered in the abovementioned logbook in respect of periods during which the said vessels are not in Mauritanian waters.

The logbooks referred to in this paragraph shall be sent to the Mauritanian authorities within 15 working days of vessels arriving in a port.

Copies of these documents shall be sent to the scientific institutes referred to in the third subparagraph of paragraph 6 below.

6. The Mauritanian authorities shall draw up the statement of fees due for the past calendar year on the basis of the catch declarations for each Community vessel and of any other information in their possession.

The previous year's statement shall reach the Commission by 31 March which shall forward it simultaneously to the shipowners and national authorities of the Member States by 15 April.

Where the shipowners dispute the statement presented by Mauritania, they may request the relevant scientific institutes, e.g. France's Institut de la Recherche Scientifique et Technique d'Outre-Mer (Orstom) and the Instituto Espa√±ol de Oceanograf√≠a (IEO), to verify the catch data before consulting with the Mauritanian authorities with a view to drawing up the final statement by 15 May of the current year. In the absence of any observations from the shipowners by that date, the statement drawn up by the Mauritanian authorities shall be deemed final. Member States shall forward to the Commission the final statements relating to their own fleets.

Any payment due in addition to the advance shall be made by the shipowners to Mauritania's fisheries authorities no later than 31 May of that year.

However, if the amount of the final statement is lower than the advance referred to in paragraph 4, the resulting balance shall not be reimbursable to the shipowner.

7. By way of derogation from Chapter I of Annex II, vessels shall be obliged within three hours of entering or leaving the zone to communicate their position and the volume of the catch on board direct to the Mauritanian authorities preferably by fax or, failing that, by radio.

The fax number and radio frequency shall be notified by the surveillance authorities.

A copy of the fax messages or of the record of radio communications shall be kept by the Mauritanian authorities and the shipowners until both parties have approved the final statement of fees referred to in paragraph 6.

8. By way of derogation from the provisions of Chapter VII of this Annex, owners of tuna seiners shall endeavour to sign on at least one Mauritanian seaman per vessel while pole-and-line tuna vessel operators must sign on three Mauritanian seamen per vessel for the duration of the voyage. This includes officers, trainee officers and scientific observers.

9. By way of derogation from point I of Chapter V of Annex II, one scientific observer per vessel may be taken on board tuna seiners for an agreed period at the request of the Mauritania authorities and by common agreement with the shipowners concerned.

CHAPTER XIV Provisions applying to pelagic freezer trawlers

1. By way of derogation from the provisions of Chapters I and II of this Annex, licence applications must reach the Ministry no later than seven days before the start of fishing operations accompanied by proof of payment and the documents attesting to the technical characteristics.

The Ministry shall draw up the fishing licences on presentation of the certificate of receipt of payment issued by the Mauritanian public treasury.

The fishing licence shall be held on board each vessel. If for practical reasons the original licence cannot be delivered to the vessel, a copy or fax may also be kept on board.

In very exceptional cases, the Ministry may grant provisional authorization of limited duration to vessels in respect of which the Mauritanian public treasury has not yet received payment of the licence fees provided that the Ministry is in possession of proof of payment.

Licences shall be issued for periods of at least a month. The validity of a licence shall in all cases cover periods of half a month.

In cases of force majeure, shipowners may, once they have suspended the licence of the vessel affected, use the remaining period of validity of the licence in question as credit towards a new licence for a replacement vessel.

2. By way of derogation from the provisions of Chapter VIII of this Annex, prior inspections of vessels shall take place in Europe. The travel and subsistence expenses of two persons designated by the Ministry to carry out the said inspections shall be payable by the shipowners.

3. The fees, inclusive of all national and local charges and taxes, and the ceilings for catches by type of vessel are specified in the datasheets contained in the Protocol.

Shipowners shall pay a sum of ECU 18 to the Mauritanian public treasury for each tonne caught in excess of the ceiling fixed by type of vessel. Declarations of catch shall be drawn up by common agreement no later than one month after the end of each year.

The fees and any additional amounts due shall be paid to one of the Central Bank of Mauritania's foreign accounts payable to the Tr√©sor de la Mauritanie.

4. In the event of a fall in the world market fob price set in Nouadhibou for the Mauritanian horse mackerel to under US $ 300 or a rise to over US $ 500 per tonne net, the Parties shall open negotiations with a view to adjusting the level of the fees.

5. By way of derogation from the provisions of Chapter I of Annex II, all vessels shall communicate to the surveillance authorities the date, the time and their position each time they enter or leave Mauritania's fishing zone, giving 12 hours advance notice when entering and 24 hours when leaving.

6. By way of derogation from Chapter VII of this Annex, vessels must sign on Mauritanian seamen of whom at least:

- 4, including one scientific observer, on board each vessel with a total crew of 30 or less,

- 5, including one scientific observer, on board each vessel with a total crew of 30 or more.

7. Vessels shall not be obliged to enter a Mauritanian port. However, shipowners must take all appropriate measures to transport the Mauritanian seamen and scientific observers at their expense.

8. Vessels shall be obliged neither to land fishery products nor tranship consumables in Mauritanian territorial waters or ports, neither shall they be subject to export duties.

9. If an offence is detected during an inspection, the master shall sign the statement to that effect. By way of derogation from point 2 of Chapter VIII of Annex II, the vessel shall thus be allowed to continue its fishing activities. The shipowners shall immediately contact the Ministry in order to reach a solution. If a solution cannot be found within 72 hours, the owners must provide a bank security covering the amount of any fines imposed.

ANNEX II

COOPERATION IN THE MONITORING OF FISHING ACTIVITIES BY COMMUNITY VESSELS IN MAURITANIA'S FISHING ZONE

CHAPTER I Entering and leaving the fishing zone

1. Except for tuna vessels and surface longliners and pelagic freezer trawlers, Community vessels operating under this Agreement must enter and leave Mauritania's fishing zone by one of two passages in the presence of the surveillance authorities:

- the northern passage, the coordinates of which are 20¬∞40'N - 17¬∞04'W,

- the southern passage, the coordinates of which are 16¬∞20'N - 16¬∞40'W.

2. Shipowners shall notify the surveillance authorities of their entry into and exit from Mauritania's fishing zone by telex, fax or mail to the numbers or address in Appendix 1 to this Annex.

The Delegation will be given 15 days prior notice of any changes in the numbers or addresses for notification.

3. The notification referred to in point 2 shall be given in the following manner:

(a) Entry

Notice must be given at least 24 hours beforehand and contain the following particulars:

- the position of the vessel at the time of notification,

- the point of entry,

- the day, date and time of entry,

- the amount and species of catch held on board at that time, where vessels have previously stated that they hold a fishing licence for another fishing zone in the subregion, in which case the surveillance authorities will have access to the fishing log concerning that zone and the checks may last longer than the period laid down in point 5 of this chapter.

(b) Exit

Notice must be given at least 48 hours beforehand in the case of the northern passage and at least 72 hours beforehand in the case of the southern passage. The following particulars must be provided:

- the position of the vessel at the time of notification,

- the point of exit,

- the day, date and time of exit,

- the amount and species of catch held on board at that time.

4. At each entry or exit, vessels shall tune their radios to the frequency of the surveillance authorities at least six hours before the time specified in the notification.

5. Controls should not normally exceed more than one hour on entry and three hours on exit.

6. In the event of the surveillance authorities being overdue or failing to appear, vessels may continue on their way once the period laid down in point 5 have expired.

In the event of a vessel being overdue or failing to appear, the surveillance authorities may consider the entry or exit notice void once the period laid down in point 5 have expired.

7. In the event of mass entries or exits, control operations shall be accelerated.

8. Failure to comply with the provisions of points 1 to 6 shall result in the following sanctions:

(a) the first time:

- the vessel shall be diverted,

- the catch on board shall be unloaded and confiscated on behalf of the Treasury,

- the vessel shall pay the minimum fine provided for in Mauritanian law;

(b) the second time:

- the vessel shall be diverted,

- the catch on board shall be unloaded and confiscated on behalf of the Treasury,

- the vessel shall pay a fine in accordance with Mauritanian law,

- the licence shall be revoked for the remainder of its period of validity;

(c) the third time:

- the vessel shall be diverted,

- the catch on board shall be unloaded and confiscated on behalf of the Treasury,

- the licence shall be definitively revoked,

- the master and the vessel shall be banned from exercising their activities in Mauritania.

CHAPTER II Innocent passage

When Community fishing vessels are exercising their right of innocent passage and navigation in Mauritania's fishing zone in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and relevant national and international legislation, they shall keep all their fishing gear stowed on board in such a way that it cannot be immediately utilized.

CHAPTER III Transhipment

1. The catches of Community vessels shall be transhipped within Mauritanian ports.

2. Any Community vessel wishing to tranship catches shall be subject to the procedure laid down in points 3 and 4.

3. The owners of such vessels shall notify the surveillance authorities at least 24 hours beforehand, using the means of communications specified in point 2 of Chapter I of this Annex, of the following:

- the names of the transhipping fishing vessels,

- the name of the cargo vessels,

- the tonnage by species to be transhipped,

- the day, date and time of transhipment.

4. Transhipment shall be considered as an exit from Mauritania's fishing zone. Vessels must therefore provide the surveillance authorities with the originals of the fishing log and the fishing log annex and state whether they intend to continue fishing or leave Mauritania's fishing zone.

5. Any transhipment of catches not covered by points 1 to 4 shall be prohibited in Mauritania's fishing zone. Any person infringing this provision shall be liable to the penalties provided for by Mauritanian law.

CHAPTER IV Inspection and controls

1. Masters of Community fishing vessels shall allow and facilitate boarding and the discharge of their duties by any Mauritanian official responsible for the inspection and control of fishing activities.

These officials shall not remain on board for longer than is necessary for the discharge of their duties.

2. The Community hereby undertakes to maintain the specific monitoring programming in Community ports. Summaries of reports on the controls carried out shall be sent periodically to the Ministry.

CHAPTER V Mauritanian scientific observers on board Community vessels

A system for observation on board Community vessels is hereby established.

1. Any Community vessel holding a licence for Mauritania's fishing zone, except for tuna seiners, shall take on board a Mauritanian scientific observer. There shall be only one observer at a time per vessel.

The Ministry shall supply the Commission each quarter before licences are issued with a list of vessels designated to take on board an observer.

2. The period spent by an observer on board a vessel shall be one trip. However, at the express request of the Ministry this period may be spread over several trips according to the average duration of trip for a particular vessel. This request will be made by the Ministry, when the name of the observer designated to board the vessel in question is notified.

Likewise, in the event of a trip being curtailed, the observer may have to make a further voyage on the same vessel.

3. The Ministry shall inform the Commission of the names of designated observers, provided with the requisite documents, at least seven working days before the scheduled date of their embarkation.

4. All costs arising out of the activities of observers, including their salary, emoluments and allowances shall be borne by the Ministry. If an observer is taken on board or disembarked at a foreign port, travelling expenses and daily allowances shall be borne by the shipowner until the observer boards the vessel or arrives at a Mauritanian port.

5. Masters of vessels designated to take on board a scientific observer shall make all the arrangements to facilitate boarding and disembarkation by the observer.

The observer shall enjoy the same treatment on board as the vessel's officers.

The observer shall be offered every facility needed to carry out his duties. The master shall give him access to the means of communication needed for the discharge of his duties, to documents directly concerned with the vessel's fishing activities, i.e. to the fishing log, the fishing log annex and navigation log, and to those parts of the vessel necessary to facilitate the exercise of his tasks as an observer.

6. The observer shall normally board and disembark at a Mauritanian port at the start of the trip, following notification of the list of designated vessels.

Within 30 days of that notification, the shipowners concerned shall give notice, using the means of communication specified in Chapter I to this Annex, of the date and port selected for the taking on of the observer.

7. The observer must report to the master of the designated vessel the day before the proposed date of his embarkation. Should the observer fail to report at the time specified, the vessel is entitled to leave the Mauritanian port with a certificate from the surveillance authorities confirming the absence of an observer.

8. Shipowners shall contribute ECU 3 per GRT per quarter per vessel to the costs of scientific observation. This contribution shall be payable at the same time as, and be additional to, the fee payable by the shipowner.

9. Failure by a shipowner to comply with the provisions relating to observers shall result in the automatic suspension of the fishing licence until the shipowner has complied with these obligations.

10. The scientific observer shall have:

- a professional qualification,

- adequate fisheries experience,

and

- a thorough understanding of this Agreement and the Mauritanian rules applicable.

11. The scientific observer shall ensure that the Community vessel operating in Mauritania's fishing zone comply with the terms of this Agreement.

He shall compile a report on this subject. In particular, he shall:

- observe the fishing activities of the vessels,

- verify the position of the vessels engaged in fishing operations,

- take biological samples as part of scientific programmes,

- record particulars of the fishing gear and the mesh size of the nets used,

- verify the entries in the fishing log.

12. Observation shall be confined to fishing activities and related activities governed by this Agreement.

13. The scientific observer shall:

- take all appropriate steps to ensure that the conditions of his boarding and his presence on the vessel neither interrupt nor hamper fishing operations,

- use the instruments and procedures approved for measuring the mesh size of nets used under this Agreement.

- treat with due care property and equipment on board the vessel and respect the confidentiality of all the vessel's papers.

14. At the end of the observation period and before leaving the vessel the observer shall draw up a report in accordance with the model in Appendix 2 to this Annex. He shall sign it in the presence of the master, who may add or cause to be added to it any observations which he considers relevant, followed by his signature. A copy of the report shall be handed to the master when the observer is put ashore.

15. The competent authorities receiving reports from scientific observers shall be obliged to check their content and conclusions as soon as possible.

Should the competent authorities find that infringements have been committed they shall take appropriate action including, in accordance with their national laws, the initiation of administrative proceedings against the natural or legal persons responsible. The proceedings initiated must, in accordance with the relevant provisions of national law, be such as effectively to deprive those responsible of any material gain from the infringement or to produce effects proportional to the gravity of the infringement so as effectively to discourage other infringements of the same nature.

Should the port of disembarkation be situated in a Member State other than the flag Member State the former shall inform the flag Member State of the measures taken.

CHAPTER VI Mutual observation system for shore-based controls

The Contracting Parties agree to set up a mutual observation system for shore-based controls with a view to improving their effectiveness.

1. Objectives

To attend the controls and inspections carried out by the national inspection authorities in order to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Agreement;

2. Status of observers

The competent authorities of each Contracting Party shall designate an observer and notify his name to the other Contracting Party.

This observer should have:

- a professional qualification,

- appropriate experience in the fisheries field,

and

- thorough knowledge of the provisions of the Agreement.

Inspections shall be carried out by the national inspection authorities and the observer in attendance may not, on his own initiative, exercise the powers of inspection conferred on national officials.

When accompanied by national officials, the observer shall have access to the vessels, premises and documents subject to inspection by the said officials.

3. Duties of observers

The observer shall accompany the national inspection authorities on their visits to the ports, on board ships in dock, to public auction houses, fish wholesalers' shops, cold stores and other premises for unloading and stocking fish before it is placed on the market.

The observer shall draw up and submit a report every four months detailing the inspections attended. This report shall be addressed to the competent authorities who shall send a copy to the other Contracting Party.

4. Implementation

The competent inspection authority of each Contracting Party shall give 10 days written notice to the other Contracting Party of the shore inspections, on a case-by-case basis, which it intends to carry out.

The other Contracting Party shall give five days notice of its intention to send an observer.

The duration of the observer mission should not exceed 15 days.

5. Confidentiality

The observer shall respect the goods and equipment on board the vessel, and any other installations, and also the confidentiality of all documents to which he has access.

He shall disclose information on the results of his work solely to his competent authorities.

6. Location

This programme will be implemented in the Community ports of landing and Mauritanian ports.

7. Financing

Each Contracting Party shall bear the costs of his observer, including travel and board.

CHAPTER VII Continuous satellite tracking system

Pending the implementation of a national satellite monitoring system for fishing vessels of similar type operating in Mauritania's fishing zone, the Contracting Parties agree to implement a private satellite tracking project for Community vessels.

1. Objectives

Continuous tracking by satellite of Community fishing vessels in Mauritania's fishing zone will enable direct administration of the provisions on fishing effort and geographical restrictions. Furthermore, it will allow for targeted inspections at sea and retrospective controls of the zones declared in the fishing log.

2. Implementation

The Contracting Parties agree to set up a working group to define the procedures for setting up, implementing and financing the project, which shall enter into force on 1 August 1997.

CHAPTER VIII Procedure in the event of boarding

1. Transmission of information

The Ministry shall inform the Delegation within 48 hours of any boarding of a Community fishing vessel operation in Mauritania's fishing zone and shall provide a brief report of the circumstances and reasons for this boarding.

2. Statement of boarding

After the Mauritanian surveillance authorities have drawn up a statement, the master of the vessel shall sign it.

This signature does not prejudice the rights of the master or any defence which he may make to the alleged infringement.

He shall take the vessel to the port of Nouadhibou. In the case of minor infringements, the surveillance authorities may authorize the vessel to continue its fishing activities.

3. Settlement of boarding

3.1. In accordance with this Agreement and Mauritanian law, infringements may be settled administratively or by legal proceedings.

3.2. In the case of an administrative settlement the amount of the fine shall be determined in accordance with Mauritanian legislation laying down minimum and maximum figures.

3.3. If there is no administrative settlement and the matter is brought before a competent judicial body, a bank security amounting to the equivalent in ecus of the maximum fine provided for in Mauritanian legislation shall be lodged by the shipowner with a bank designated by the Ministry.

3.4. The bank security shall be irrevocable until the legal proceedings have been concluded. It shall be released by the Ministry once legal proceedings end without a conviction. Similarly, in the event of a conviction leading to a fine of less than the security lodged, the balance shall be released by the Ministry.

3.5. The vessel shall be released and its crew authorized to leave the port:

- either as soon as the obligations imposed by the administrative settlement procedure have been completed on presentation of the receipt for the settlement,

or

- when the bank security referred to in point 3.3 has been lodged and accepted by the Ministry, pending completion of the legal proceedings.

CHAPTER IX Discarding at sea

The Contracting Parties shall look into the problem of discards from fishing vessels and shall examine ways of turning these to account.

CHAPTER X Fight against illegal fishing

In an effort to curb illegal fishing activities in Mauritania's fishing zone which jeopardize fisheries management policy, the Contracting Parties agree to exchange information on these activities on a regular basis.

In addition to the measures already applied by the Contracting Parties under existing legislation, they shall consult one another on the possibility of taking supplementary joint or individual action. To this end, they shall step up cooperation, in particular on the fight against illegal fishing.
