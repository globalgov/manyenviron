MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING CONCERNING THE CONSERVATION
OF THE MANATEE AND SMALL CETACEANS OF WESTERN AFRICA AND
MACARONESIA
Among the States of western Africa and Macaronesia:
The undersigned,
Acknowledging the role of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species
of Wild Animals (CMS) in the conservation and management of aquatic mammals;
Aware of international responsibilities to conserve the West African manatee and
small cetaceans of the African Eastern Atlantic Basin and Macaronesia, in particular,
pursuant to the Convention on Biological Diversity, for which CMS is the lead partner
in the global conservation of migratory species over their entire range;
Recognising the need of aquatic mammal conservation at the global level as
reflected, inter alia, in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the
International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling and the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES);
Further recognising the importance of the instruments, policies and strategies
specific to the region, in particular, the Convention for the Co-operation in the
Protection and Development of the Marine and Coastal Environment of the West and
Central African Region (Abidjan Convention), as well as the CMS Memoranda of
Understanding Concerning Conservation Measures for Marine Turtles of the Atlantic
Coast of Africa and Concerning Conservation Measures for the Eastern Atlantic
Populations of the Mediterranean Monk Seal;
Also aware of the region's exceptionally rich aquatic biodiversity, which, in addition to
the West African manatee, harbours more than 30 species of small cetaceans;
Convinced of the need to ensure, for the benefit of present and future generations,
the conservation of manatees and small cetaceans, which are part of the region's
aquatic environments, where they constitute a link between the cultures and the
ecosystems;
Conscious that manatees occur over vast areas, making their survival dependent on
their conservation over the entire range of their coastal and inland water habitats;
Conscious too that small cetaceans migrate and disperse over vast distances,
making their survival dependent on their conservation over a wide area and in a wide
range of marine habitats;
Emphasising that knowledge of the biology, ecology, migration, population
abundance and the conservation status of manatees and small cetaceans is
insufficient and that international cooperation is urgently needed to facilitate research
and monitoring of these species in order to develop and implement conservation
measures;

Concerned that the existence of the manatees frequenting coastal and inland waters
of the region's Western African Range States is threatened by by-catch, hunting and
habitat destruction due to pollution, overexploitation and constructions;
Equally concerned that the conservation status of small cetacean populations
frequenting the marine and coastal waters of the region's Range States, particularly
populations that have been severely depleted, can be affected by factors such as
directed take and by-catch, degradation, disturbance or destruction of their habitats,
chemical and acoustic pollution, decline in food availability, climate change, use and
abandonment of fishing gear and ship strikes;
Emphasising that many activities in the region, such as fishing, tourism and oil and
gas exploration, extraction and other mining activities, while socially and
economically important, should be conducted in a sustainable manner to minimise
the threats to manatees and small cetaceans;
Emphasising further that the particular vulnerability of manatee and small cetacean
populations warrants the implementation of conservation measures where they do
not already exist;
Acknowledging further that the Range States have endeavoured individually to
ensure conservation of manatees and small cetaceans; nevertheless, coordinated
and concerted actions across the migratory range are still required to improve and
ensure their conservation;
Noting that the CMS calls for international cooperation to conserve migratory species
and encourages Contracting Parties to conclude agreements, including non-legally
binding instruments, in respect of populations of migratory species;
Recalling that Resolutions 7.7 and 8.5, as well as Recommendation 7.3, of the CMS
Conference of the Parties invite CMS Contracting Parties in the region to conclude a
Memorandum of Understanding on manatees and small cetaceans and undertake
collaborative actions through action plans;
Also recalling the recommendations for the conservation of small cetaceans and
manatees formulated at the workshop on "The Conservation and Management of
Small Cetaceans of the Coast of Africa", held in Conakry, Guinea, in May 2000;
Encouraged by the efficacy of existing cetacean-related instruments negotiated
under the auspices of CMS such as the Agreement on the Conservation of
Cetaceans of the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area
(ACCOBAMS), the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic,
North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS) and the Memorandum of
Understanding Concerning the Conservation of Cetaceans and their Habitats in the
Pacific Islands Region;
Recognising further that the scientific bodies of existing CMS instruments and the
CMS Scientific Council have scientific and technical expertise that can be shared
with the region to support the implementation of this Memorandum of Understanding;
Noting further that the region's coastal communities, and those communities living
along inland waters, value manatees and small cetaceans as part of their cultural

heritage, and recognise that the species are significant components of the region's
biodiversity because of their particular ecological, economic, scientific, educational
and tourism values;
Acknowledging the shared responsibility of the Range States, including all
government agencies concerned with the environment, fisheries, development and
extractive industries, intergovernmental organisations, the non-governmental sector,
the private sector, including oil and mining companies, the fish and aquaculture
industries, and tour operators, to work with local communities to achieve and
maintain a favourable conservation status for the region's manatees, small cetaceans
and their habitats;
Confirming that the Signatories have the primary responsibility to implement this
Memorandum of Understanding;
DECIDE to work closely together in the region and to foster cooperation, build
capacity and ensure coordinated region-wide actions to achieve and maintain a
favourable conservation status for manatees and small cetaceans and their habitats
and to safeguard the associated values of these species for the people of the region.
To this end and in the spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation, the Signatories
record their understanding that their governments will individually or collectively:
1. Take steps as Range States for the respective species to conserve manatees
and small cetaceans and fully protect those species listed in CMS Appendix I
that occur in the region.
2. Consider, as appropriate, ratifying or acceding to those biodiversity-related
international instruments that complement the intent of this Memorandum of
Understanding, including in particular CMS, so as to enhance the legal
protection of the region's manatees and small cetaceans.
3. Enact or update, as appropriate, legislation and enforce it to conserve the
manatees and small cetaceans of the region.
4. Implement, in the case of a Range State for the respective species and subject
to the availability of necessary resources, the provisions of the Action Plans
attached as annexes to this Memorandum of Understanding as a basis to
conserve populations of manatees and small cetaceans in the region.
5. Facilitate the rapid exchange of scientific, technical and legal information
necessary to coordinate conservation measures, and cooperate with recognised
experts and collaborating organisations to facilitate the work conducted in
relation to the Action Plans.
6. Assess the implementation of this Memorandum of Understanding, including the
Action Plans, at regular meetings to be attended by representatives of each of
the signatories, and persons or organisations technically qualified in manatee
and small cetacean conservation. Where appropriate, such meetings may be
held back-to-back with other events, such as meetings of the Conference of
Parties to CMS.
