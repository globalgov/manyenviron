The undersigned, acting on behalf of the respective authorities named above,
Aware that the populations of marine turtles frequenting the territorial waters and beaches of the
Atlantic coast of Africa, from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Cape of Good Hope, including Macaronesia,
are seriously threatened;
Recognizing that members of the six species of marine turtles concerned -- namely, Caretta
caretta, Chelonia mydas, Dermochelys coriacea, Eretmochelys imbricata, Lepidochelys kempii, and
Lepidochelys olivacea -- are highly migratory, which makes their survival dependent on the conservation
of widespread marine habitats (including migratory corridors, coral reefs, feeding grounds, and nesting
beaches);
Aware that pollution of various marine habitats, destruction of coastal wetlands, industrial fishing
activities, international trade and other man-induced threats, if not properly mitigated and managed, could
lead to a further decline in marine turtle populations;
Concerned also by the harm caused to marine turtles by trawlers and other vessels of third
countries operating in the waters covered by the present Memorandum;
Noting that marine turtles are listed in Appendices I and II of the Convention on the
Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals and, therefore, are the object of concerted and cooperative
actions under that Convention;
Noting the existence of other international instruments relevant for the conservation of marine
turtles on the Atlantic coast of Africa, notably the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, the Convention for Cooperation in the Protection and Development
of the Marine and Coastal Environment of the West and Central African Region, and the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea;
Acknowledging their shared responsibility for the conservation and wise management of the
marine turtle populations frequenting their waters and shores, and the desirability of involving all Range
States, as well as concerned third parties and relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental
organizations, in a common initiative;
Conscious that concerted, co-ordinated action must be taken immediately to address the threats
posed to the existing populations;
AGREE to work closely together to improve the conservation status of the marine turtles and the habitats
on which they depend.
To that end, in a spirit of mutual understanding and co-operation, they shall:
1. Endeavour to put in place measures for the conservation and, where necessary and appropriate,
strict protection of marine turtles at all stages of their life cycle (including eggs, hatchlings, juveniles, subadults
and adults);
2. Review and, as necessary, revise national legislation, and ratify or accede to those international
conventions most relevant for the conservation of marine turtles, so as to enhance the legal protection
given to these species;
3. Implement in their respective countries, subject to availability of necessary resources, the
provisions of the Conservation Plan annexed to this memorandum. The Conservation Plan shall aim to
improve basic knowledge of species and migration routes, reduce mortality of marine turtles, enhance
co-operation among Range States and secure funding for the initiation and/or continuation of
conservation programmes. It shall include inter alia protection measures for beaches used by marine
turtles for nesting and measures to reduce, as far as possible, the taking of marine turtles, particularly in
areas used for foraging. The Conservation Plan shall also provide for the identification of key habitats
for nesting and foraging; for population monitoring and research; and the eventual preparation of national
marine turtle action plans that take into account the needs of local human populations. Implementation
of this Memorandum, including the Conservation Plan, shall be assessed at regular meetings to be
attended by representatives of each of the Governments concerned and persons or organizations
technically qualified in, or relevant to, the conservation of marine turtles. Such meetings shall be
convened by the Secretariat of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild
Animals, and shall be hosted by and organized in collaboration with one of the Range States.
4. Facilitate the expeditious exchange of scientific, technical and legal information needed to coordinate
conservation measures; and co-operate with recognized scientists of international organizations
and other Range States in order to facilitate their work conducted in relation to the Conservation Plan;
5. Designate a national correspondent to serve as a focal point for the Parties and communicate
without delay the name and complete contact details of this correspondent (and any changes thereto)
to the Secretariat of the Convention on Migratory Species;
6. Provide to the Secretariat of the Convention on Migratory Species, no later than 30 September
of each year, an annual report on implementation of this Memorandum in each of the respective
countries. The Secretariat shall transmit to each of the Range States all of the reports received, together
with an overview report which it shall compile on the basis of information at its disposal.
Basic principles
1. This Memorandum of Understanding shall be considered an agreement under Article IV,
paragraph 4, of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. The
Memorandum shall take effect on 1 July 1999 for all Range States that have signed it. It shall remain
open for signature indefinitely, and shall become effective for all other signatory States on the first day
of the first month following the date on which they sign. The Memorandum of Understanding shall
remain in effect indefinitely subject to the right of any Party to terminate its participation by providing
one year's written notice to all of the other Parties.
2. The Memorandum of Understanding, including the Conservation Plan, may be amended by
consensus of the signatory States.
3. The working language for all matters related to this Memorandum of Understanding shall be
English and French, each version being equally authentic.
