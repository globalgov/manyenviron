3. The EC Commission and the EFTA Surveillance Authority shall receive any complaints concerning the application of this Agreement. They shall inform each other of complaints received.

4. Each of these bodies shall examine all complaints falling within its competence and shall pass to the other body any complaints which fall within the competence of that body.

5. In case of disagreement between these two bodies with regard to the action to be taken in relation to a complaint or with regard to the result of the examination, either of the bodies may refer the matter to the EEA Joint Committee which shall deal with it in accordance with Article 111.

Article 110

Decisions under this Agreement by the EFTA Surveillance Authority and the EC Commission which impose a pecuniary obligation on persons other than States, shall be enforceable. The same shall apply to such judgments under this Agreement by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, the Court of First Instance of the European Communities and the EFTA Court.

Enforcement shall be governed by the rules of civil procedure in force in the State in the territory of which it is carried out. The order for its enforcement shall be appended to the decision, without other formality than verification of the authenticity of the decision, by the authority which each Contracting Party shall designate for this purpose and shall make known to the other Contracting Parties, the EFTA Surveillance Authority, the EC Commission, the Court of Justice of the European Communities, the Court of First Instance of the European Communities and the EFTA Court.

When these formalities have been completed on application by the party concerned, the latter may proceed to enforcement, in accordance with the law of the State in the territory of which enforcement is to be carried out, by bringing the matter directly before the competent authority.

Enforcement may be suspended only by a decision of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, as far as decisions by the EC Commission, the Court of First Instance of the European Communities or the Court of Justice of the European Communities are concerned, or by a decision of the EFTA Court as far as decisions by the EFTA Surveillance Authority or the EFTA Court are concerned.

If the EEA Joint Committee in such a dispute has not reached an agreement on a solution within six months from the date on which this procedure was initiated or if, by then, the Contracting Parties to the dispute have not decided to ask for a ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, a Contracting Party may, in order to remedy possible imbalances,

- either take a safeguard measure in accordance with Article 112(2) and following the procedure of Article 113;

- or apply Article 102 mutatis mutandis.

The Commission proposal strengthens the protection of patients, users and third persons by referring to harmonized standards which are to be adopted by CEN-CENELEC in accordance with the legal requirements and by subjecting these products to appropriate conformity assessment procedures including a third-party intervention for certain devices.

JOINT DECLARATION

concerning nationals of the Republic of Iceland who hold a diploma in specialized medicine, specialized dentistry, veterinary medicine, pharmacy, general medical practice or architecture conferred in a third country

anxious, however, to take account of the special position of nationals of the Republic of Iceland who, since there is no complete university training in specialized medicine, specialized dentistry, veterinary medicine and architecture in Iceland itself, since there are limited possibilities of training in specialized dentistry and of specific training in general medical practice and other specialization in medicine, and since there is only recently a complete university training in pharmacy offered in Iceland, have studied in a third country;

the Contracting Parties hereby recommend that the Governments concerned should allow nationals of the Republic of Iceland who hold a diploma in specialized dentistry, in veterinary medicine, in architecture, in pharmacy, on completion of specific training in general medical practice or of specializations in medicine, awarded in a third country and recognized by the competent Icelandic authorities, to take up and pursue activities as specialists in dentistry, veterinary surgeons, architects, pharmacists, general medical practitioners or specialists in medicine within the European Economic Area, by recognizing these diplomas in their territories.

anxious, however, to take account of the special position of nationals of the Republic of Iceland who, since there are limited possibilities of post-secondary education and a long tradition of students receiving this education abroad, have studied in a third country;

the Contracting Parties hereby recommend that the Governments concerned should allow nationals of the Republic of Iceland who hold a diploma of studies covered by the general system, awarded in a third country and recognized by the competent Icelandic authorities, to take up and pursue within the European Economic Area the activities of the professions concerned, by recognizing these diplomas in their territories.

JOINT DECLARATION

on transport of goods by road

If the European Community elaborates new legislation to amend, replace or prolong the application of rules on access to the market in transport of goods by road (First Council Directive of 23 July 1962 on certain types of carriage of goods between Member States, OJ No 70, 6.8.1962, p. 2005/62; Council Directive 65/269/EEC, OJ No 88, 24.5.1965, p. 1469/65; Council Regulation (EEC) No 3164/76, OJ No L 357, 29.12.1976, p. 1; Council Decision 80/48/EEC, OJ No L 18, 24.1.1980, p. 21; Council Regulation (EEC) No 4059/89, OJ No L 390, 30.12.1989, p. 3) the Contracting Parties shall, in accordance with the jointly agreed procedures, take a decision concerning an amendment of the relevant Annex, allowing carriers of the Contracting Parties reciprocal and mutual access to the market in transport of goods by road on equal terms.

For the duration of the Agreement between the European Communities and Austria on transport of goods by road and rail, future amendments of the present Agreement shall not affect the existing mutual rights for market access referred to in Article 16 of the Agreement between the European Communities and Austria on transport of goods by road and rail, and as set out in the bilateral Agreements between Austria on the one hand and Finland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland on the other hand, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties concerned.

JOINT DECLARATION

on Article 61(3)(b) of the Agreement

The Contracting Parties take note that even if eligibility of the regions has to be denied in the context of Article 61(3)(a) and according to the criteria of the first stage of analysis under subparagraph (c) (see Commission communication on the method for the application of Article 92(3)(a) and (c) to regional aid, OJ No C 212, 12.8.1988, p. 2) examination according to other criteria, e.g. very low population density, is possible.

JOINT DECLARATION

on aid granted through the EC structural Funds or other financial instruments

The Contracting Parties declare that financial support to undertakings financed by the EC structural Funds or receiving assistance from the European Investment Bank or from any other similar financial instrument or fund shall be in keeping with the provisions of this Agreement on State aid. They declare that exchange of information and views on these forms of aid shall take place at the request of either surveillance authority.

JOINT DECLARATION

on paragraph (c) of Protocol 27 to the Agreement

The notice referred to in paragraph (c) of Protocol 27 shall contain a description of the State aid programme or case concerned, including all elements which are necessary for a proper evaluation of the programme or case (depending on the State aid elements concerned, such as type of State aid, budget, beneficiary, duration). Moreover, the reasons for the opening of the procedure referred to in Article 93(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community or of the corresponding procedure set out in an agreement between the EFTA States establishing the EFTA Surveillance Authority shall be communicated to the other surveillance authority. Exchange of information between the two surveillance authorities shall take place on a reciprocal basis.

JOINT DECLARATION

on shipbuilding

The Contracting Parties agree that, until the expiry of the Seventh Shipbuilding Directive (i.e. at the end of 1993), they will refrain from the application of the general rules on State aid laid down in Article 61 of the Agreement to the sector of shipbuilding.

Article 62(2) of the Agreement as well as the Protocols referring to State aid are applicable to the sector of shipbuilding.

JOINT DECLARATION

on applicable procedures in cases where, by virtue of Article 76 and Part VI of the Agreement and corresponding Protocols, EFTA States participate fully in EC committees

The EFTA States shall have the same rights and obligations as EC Member States within EC committees in which they participate fully, by virtue of Article 76 and Part VI of the Agreement and the corresponding Protocols, except in respect of voting procedures, if any. In reaching its decision, the EC Commission shall take due account of the views expressed by the EFTA States in the same manner as of the views expressed by the EC Member States before voting.

In cases where the EC Member States have the possibility of appealing to the EC Council against the decision of the EC Commission, the EFTA States may raise the issue in the EEA Joint Committee in conformity with Article 5 of the Agreement.

JOINT DECLARATION

on cooperation in cultural affairs

The Contracting Parties, having regard to their cooperation within the Council of Europe, recalling the Declaration of 9 April 1984 from the Ministerial meeting in Luxembourg between the European Community and its Member States and the States of the European Free Trade Association, mindful that the establishment of the free movement of goods, services, capital and persons within the EEA will have a significant impact in the field of culture, declare their intention to strengthen and broaden cooperation in the area of cultural affairs, in order to contribute to a better understanding between the peoples of a multicultural Europe and to safeguard and further develop the national and regional heritage that enriches European culture by its diversity.

JOINT DECLARATION

on cooperation against illegal traffic in cultural goods

The Contracting Parties declare their willingness to establish cooperation arrangements and procedures against illegal traffic in cultural goods as well as arrangements concerning the management of the regime for regular traffic in cultural goods.

Without prejudice to the provisions of the EEA Agreement and other international obligations, these arrangements and procedures shall take into account the legislation which the Community is developing in this field.

JOINT DECLARATION

on the association of Community experts with the work of committees among the EFTA States or set up by the EFTA Surveillance Authority

JOINT DECLARATION

on Article 103 of the Agreement

It is the understanding of the Contracting Parties that the reference to the fulfilment of constitutional requirements contained in Article 103(1) of the Agreement and the reference to provisional application contained in Article 103(2) have no practical implications for internal Community procedures.

JOINT DECLARATION

on Protocol 35 to the Agreement

It is the understanding of the Contracting Parties that Protocol 35 does not restrict the effects of those existing internal rules which provide for direct effect and primacy of international agreements.

JOINT DECLARATION

concerning the Financial Mechanism

Should an EFTA Contracting Party withdraw from EFTA and accede to the Community, appropriate arrangements should be made to ensure that no additional financial obligations are, as a result, incurred by the remaining EFTA States. The Contracting Parties note in this regard the decision by the EFTA States to calculate their respective contributions to the Financial Mechanism based on the GNP at market price data for the three most recent years. As regards any acceding EFTA State, appropriate and equitable solutions should be found in the context of the accession negotiations.

JOINT DECLARATION

on the relation between the EEA Agreement and existing agreements

The EEA Agreement shall not affect rights assured through existing agreements binding one or more EC Member States, on the one hand, and one or more EFTA States, on the other, or two or more EFTA States, such as among other agreements concerning individuals, economic operators, regional cooperation and administrative arrangements, until at least equivalent rights have been achieved under the Agreement.

JOINT DECLARATION

on the agreed interpretation of Article 4(1) and (2) of Protocol 9 on trade in fish and other marine products

1. While the EFTA States will not take over the 'acquis communautaire` concerning the fishery policy, it is understood that, where reference is made to aid granted through State resources, any distortion of competition is to be assessed by the Contracting Parties in the context of Articles 92 and 93 of the EEC Treaty and in relation to relevant provisions of the 'acquis communautaire` concerning the fishery policy and the content of the Joint Declaration regarding Article 61(3)(c) of the Agreement.

2. While the EFTA States will not take over the 'acquis communautaire` concerning the fishery policy, it is understood that, where reference is made to legislation relating to the organization of the market, any distortion of competition caused by such legislation is to be assessed in relation to the principles of the 'acquis communautaire` concerning the common organization of the market.

Whenever an EFTA State maintains or introduces national provisions on market organization in the fisheries sector, such provisions shall be considered a priori to be compatible with the principles, referred to in the first subparagraph, if they contain at least the following elements:

(a) the legislation on producers' organizations reflects the principles of the 'acquis communautaire` regarding:

- establishment on the producers' initiative;

- freedom to become and cease to be a member;

- absence of a dominant position, unless necessary in pursuance of objectives corresponding to those specified in Article 39 of the EEC Treaty;

(b) whenever the rules of producers' organizations are extended to non-members of producers' organizations, the provisions to be applied correspond to those laid down in Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 3687/91;

(c) whenever provisions in respect of interventions to support prices exist or are established, they correspond to those specified in Title III of Regulation (EEC) No 3687/91.

JOINT DECLARATION

concerning the application of tariff concessions for certain agricultural products

The Contracting Parties declare that in the case of tariff concessions granted for the same product, both under Protocol 3 to the Agreement and under a bilateral agreement on trade in agricultural products as referred to in Protocol 42 to the abovementioned Agreement, the more advantageous tariff treatment shall be granted upon submission of the relevant documentation.

This is without prejudice to the obligations resulting from Article 16 of the Agreement.

JOINT DECLARATION

on plant health issues

The Contracting Parties state that the existing Community acts in this area are under review. Therefore, this legislation will not be taken over by the EFTA States. New rules will be dealt with according to Articles 99 and 102 of the Agreement.

JOINT DECLARATION

on mutual assistance between control authorities in the area of spirit drinks

The Contracting Parties agree that any future EC legislation on mutual assistance in the area of spirit drinks between the competent authorities of EC Member States, relevant for this Agreement, shall be dealt with according to the general provisions on decision-making of the Agreement.

JOINT DECLARATION

on Protocol 47 on the abolition of technical barriers to trade in wine

The adaptation concerning the use of the terms 'Federweiss` and 'Federweisser` as provided for in the Appendix to Protocol 47, shall be without prejudice to any future modifications of the relevant Community legislation where provisions may be introduced regulating the use of the same terms and their equivalents for wine produced in the Community.

The classification of EFTA States' wine-producing regions in wine-growing zone B for the purposes of this Agreement, shall not prejudge any future modifications of the Community's classification scheme which may have a subsequent impact on the classification within the framework of the Agreement. Any such modifications shall be dealt with in accordance with the general provisions of the Agreement.

JOINT DECLARATION

on modification of tariff concessions and on special treatment of Spain and Portugal

A full implementation of the system outlined in Protocol 3 depends in some Contracting Parties on amendments to the national price compensation system. These amendments are not possible without the modification of tariff concessions. Such modifications would not imply the need for compensation between the Contracting Parties of the EEA Agreement.

The system outlined in Protocol 3 does not preclude the application of the relevant transitional provisions of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal and shall not result in the Community, in its composition as of 31 December 1985, granting Contracting Parties to the EEA Agreement a more favourable treatment than the one applied to the new EC Member States. In particular, the application of this system does not preclude the application of the accession price compensatory amounts established in application of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal.

JOINT DECLARATION

on animal welfare

Notwithstanding the provisions of point 2, Chapter I (veterinary issues) of Annex I to the Agreement, the Contracting Parties note the new development of the Community legislation in this area and agree to consult each other in case differences in their legislations concerning animal welfare constitute barriers to the free movement of goods. The Contracting Parties agree to monitor the situation in this area.

JOINT DECLARATION

on the Harmonized System

The Contracting Parties agree to harmonize as soon as possible, and by 31 December 1992 at the latest, the German text of the description of goods in the Harmonized System, contained in the relevant Protocols and Annexes to the EEA Agreement.

DECLARATION

by the Governments of the Member States of the EC and the EFTA States on the facilitation of border controls

In order to promote the free movement of persons, the Member States of the EC and the EFTA States shall, subject to the practical modalities to be defined in appropriate fora, cooperate with a view to the facilitation of controls for each other's citizens and the members of their families at borders between their territories.

DECLARATION

by the Governments of the Member States of the EC and the EFTA States on political dialogue

The European Community and its Member States and the Member States of the European Free Trade Association expressed their wish to strengthen their political dialogue on foreign policy with the view to developing closer relations in spheres of mutual interest.

They agreed to that end:

- to hold informal exchanges of view at ministerial level at meetings of the EEA Council. As appropriate these exchanges of view could be prepared by meetings at political directors' level;

- to make full use of existing diplomatic channels, in particular the diplomatic representations in the capital of the country holding the EC Presidency, in Brussels and in the capitals of the EFTA Countries;

- to consult informally at conferences and in international organizations;

- that this will in no way affect or replace existing bilateral contacts in this field.

Dear Mr Hafstein,

I refer to our discussions concerning the EEA interim phase and understand that we agree to set up an interim arrangement to prepare for the orderly entry into force of the Agreement.

Under this arrangement, the structures and procedures established during the EEA negotiations will be maintained. A High-Level Interim Group assisted by expert interim groups, analogous to the previous High-Level Negotiating Group and the negotiating groups, composed by representatives of the Community and of the EFTA States, will inter alia examine in the EEA context Community 'acquis` issued between 1 August 1991 and the entry into force of the Agreement. Consensus will be recorded and finalized either in Additional Protocols to be attached to the EEA Agreement, or in appropriate decisions by the EEA Joint Committee after the entry into force of the Agreement. Any substantial negotiating problems arising under the interim arrangement will be dealt with by the EEA Joint Committee after the entry into force of the Agreement.

It being understood that the information and consultation procedures of the EEA Agreement can only be applied after the latter's entry into force, the Community will inform the EFTA States during the interim phase on proposals for new Community 'acquis` after they have been submitted to the EC Council of Ministers.

I would be grateful for confirmation of your agreement on this interim arrangement.

Yours sincerely,

Brussels,

Subject: Publication of EEA relevant information

Sir,

With regard to publication of EEA relevant information to be published after the entry into force of the EEA Agreement, I have the honour to summarize the agreement we have reached as follows.

There will be a coordinated system consisting of the Official Journal of the EC and a special EEA supplement thereto. Where information to be published both for the EC and the EFTA States is identical, publication by the EC in the Official Journal of the EC will serve at the same time as publication in the three common EC/EFTA languages, while the information in the remaining four EFTA languages (Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian and Swedish) will be published in the EEA supplement to the Official Journal of the EC. The EFTA States undertake to provide an appropriate infrastructure in order to ensure the timely availability of the necessary translations into the four non-EC/EFTA languages. The EFTA States will be responsible for producing the material for the production of the EEA supplement.

The publication system would contain the following elements:

(a) Decisions of the EEA Joint Committee relating to the 'acquis` and other decisions, acts, notices, etc., by the EEA organs

The decisions of the EEA Joint Committee relating to the 'acquis` shall be published in the nine official languages in a special EEA section of the Official Journal of the EC. That publication will serve as publication in relation to the three common languages. These decisions will also be published in the EEA supplement in the official languages of the Nordic EFTA States and, under the responsibility of the EFTA States, possibly, for information, in the EFTA working language.

The same applies to other decisions, acts, notices, etc., by the EEA organs, in particular the EEA Council and the EEA Joint Committee.

As concerns decisions by the EEA Joint Committee relating to the 'acquis`, the table of contents of the EEA section will contain references to where the relevant internal EC texts can be found.

(b) EFTA data with EC relevance

Information emanating from the EFTA States, the EFTA Surveillance Authority, the Standing Committee of the EFTA States and the EFTA Court regarding, for example, competition, State aid, public procurement and technical standards will be published in the nine official languages of the EC in a special EEA section of the Official Journal of the EC. That publication will also serve as publication for the EFTA States for the three common languages whereas the other four EFTA languages will be produced in the EEA supplement. Where relevant, the table of contents of the EEA section and the EEA supplement, respectively, will contain references to where the corresponding information emanating from the EC and its Member States can be found.

(c) EC data with EFTA relevance

Information emanating from the EC and its Member States regarding, for example, competition, State aid, public procurement and technical standards will be published in the nine official languages of the EC in the Official Journal of the EC. That publication will also serve as publication for the EFTA States for the three common languages whereas the other four EFTA languages will be produced in the EEA supplement. Where relevant, reference will be made to where the corresponding information emanating from the EFTA States, the EFTA Surveillance Authority, the Standing Committee of the EFTA States and the EFTA Court can be found.

The financial aspects of the publication system will be the subject of a separate arrangement.

I should be obliged if you would confirm that you are in agreement with the above.

Please accept, Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration.

Dear Mr Hafstein,

With regard to the publication of the EFTA notices in the Official Journal of the EC as provided for in Annex XVI to the EEA Agreement and in particular in paragraph 2(a) and (b) thereof, I have the honour to summarize the agreement we have reached as follows:

(e) the EFTA notices shall be sent in the format of the model notices annexed to the acts referred to in Annex XVI; however, with a view to setting up an efficient and timely system of translation and publication, the EFTA States take note that they are recommended to set up standardized notices for each of their States along the lines of those recommended for each of the 12 Member States in Recommendation 91/561/EEC of 24 October 1991 (1);

(f) the contracts signed in 1988 and 1989 by the EC Commission acting through the OPOCE and the respective designated contractors of Sweden, Norway, Finland, Switzerland and Austria on the publication of EFTA supply contracts covered by the GATT Agreement on Government Procurement shall be terminated by the time the EEA Agreement enters into force;

AGREED MINUTES of the negotiations for an Agreement between the European Economic Community, the European Coal and Steel Community and their Member States and the EFTA States on the European Economic Area

The Contracting Parties agreed that:

Ad Article 26 and Protocol 13

before the entry into force of the Agreement the Community shall, together with the interested EFTA States, examine whether the conditions are fulfilled in which Article 26 of the Agreement, irrespective of the provisions set forth in the first paragraph in Protocol 13, will apply between the Community and the EFTA States concerned in the fisheries sector;

Ad Article 56(3)

the word 'appreciable` in Article 56(3) of the Agreement is understood to have the meaning it has in the Commission Notice of 3 September 1986 on agreements of minor importance which do not fall under Article 85(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community (OJ No C 231, 12.9.1986, p. 2);

Ad Article 90

the rules of procedure of the EEA Council will make it clear that, when taking decisions, EFTA Ministers speak with one voice;

Ad Article 91

the EEA Council shall, if necessary, provide in its rules of procedure for the possibility of establishing any subcommittee or working party;

Ad Article 91(2)

the rules of procedure of the EEA Council will make it clear that the words 'whenever circumstances so require`, in Article 91(2), cover the situation where a Contracting Party makes use of its 'droit d'évocation` in conformity with Article 89(2);

Ad Article 94(3)

it is understood that the EEA Joint Committee will at one of its first meetings, when adopting its rules of procedure, decide on the setting-up of subcommittees or working groups particularly needed to assist it in carrying out its tasks, e.g. in the field of origin and other customs matters;

Ad Article 102(5)

in the case of a provisional suspension under Article 102(5) the scope and entry into force thereof shall be adequately published;

Ad Article 102(6)

Article 102(6) applies only to actually acquired rights but not to expectations only. Some examples of such acquired rights would be:

- a suspension relating to free movement of workers will not affect the right of a worker to remain in a Contracting Party he had moved to already before the rules were suspended;

- a suspension relating to freedom of establishment will not affect the rights of a company in a Contracting Party in which it had established itself already before the rules were suspended;

- a suspension relating to investment, e.g. in real estate, will not affect investments made already before the date of suspension;

- a suspension relating to public procurement will not affect the execution of a contract awarded already before the suspension;

- a suspension relating to the recognition of a diploma shall not affect the right of a holder of such a diploma to continue his professional activities thereunder in a Contracting Party not having awarded the diploma;

Ad Article 103

if a decision is adopted by the EEA Council, Article 103(1) shall apply;

Ad Article 109(3)

the term 'application` in Article 109(3) also covers implementation of the Agreement;

Ad Article 111

suspension is not in the interest of the good functioning of the Agreement and all efforts should be made to avoid it;

Ad Article 112(1)

the provisions of Article 112(1) also cover the situation in a given area;

Ad Article 123

they would not make improper use of provisions in Article 123 to prevent the disclosure of information in the field of competition;

Ad Article 129

should any one of them not be prepared to ratify the Agreement, the signatories shall review the situation;

Ad Article 129

should any one of them not ratify the Agreement, the remaining Contracting Parties shall convene a diplomatic conference to assess the effects of the non-ratification for the Agreement and to examine the possibility of adopting a Protocol containing the amendments which will be subject to necessary internal procedures. Such a conference shall be convened as soon as it has become clear that one of the Contracting Parties will not ratify the Agreement or at the latest if the date of entry into force of the Agreement is not respected;

Ad Protocol 3

Appendices 2 to 7 will be completed before the entry into force of the Agreement; Appendices 2 to 7 shall be worked out as soon as possible and in any case before 1 July 1992. With regard to Appendix 2 experts shall work out a list of raw materials subject to price compensation on the basis of raw materials subject to price compensation measures in the Contracting Parties prior to the entry into force of the Agreement;

Ad Protocol 3, Article 11

with a view to facilitating the application of Protocol No 2 of the Free Trade Agreements, the provisions of Protocol No 3 to each of these Free Trade Agreements concerning the definition of the concept of 'originating products` and methods of administrative cooperation shall be amended before the entry into force of the EEA Agreement. These amendments shall aim at bringing the abovementioned provisions, inter alia those concerning proof of origin and administrative cooperation, as much in line with those of Protocol 4 of the EEA Agreement as possible while maintaining the 'diagonal` cumulation system and the corresponding provisions currently applicable in the framework of Protocol No 3.

Norway acknowledges that such decisions should continue to be addressed directly to these enterprises and that they should fulfil their obligations in accordance with the present practice. The said constitutional limitations to direct enforceability of decisions by the EC institutions regarding pecuniary obligations do not apply to subsidiaries and assets in the territory of the Community belonging to enterprises located in Norway. If difficulties should arise, Norway is prepared to enter into consultations and work towards a mutually satisfactory solution.

The Seventh Directive expires at the end of 1993. In deciding whether a new Directive is necessary, the Commission will also review the competitive situation in shipbuilding throughout the EEA in the light of progress made towards the reduction or elimination of contract-related production aid.

DECLARATION

Those experts will be involved on an equal footing together with national experts from the EC Member States in the work preparatory to the convening of the EC committees relevant to the 'acquis` in question. The EC Commission will pursue consultations as long as deemed necessary, until the Commission submits its proposal at a formal meeting.

DECLARATION

by the European Community on article 103 of the Agreement

In case of a positive outcome of the constitutional referendum, best efforts will be undertaken in order to proceed to the transformation of customs duties of a fiscal nature into internal taxes by the end of 1996.

DECLARATION

by the European Community on bilateral agreements

The Community considers that

- the bilateral agreements on transport of goods by road and rail between the European Economic Community and Austria and between the European Economic Community and Switzerland,

- the bilateral agreements on certain arrangements concerning agriculture between the European Economic Community and each EFTA State,

- the bilateral agreements on fisheries between the European Economic Community and Sweden, the European Economic Community and Norway and the European Economic Community and Iceland,

notwithstanding the fact that these agreements have been laid down in separate legal instruments, are part of the overall balance of the results of the negotiations and essential elements for its approval of the EEA Agreement.

The Community therefore reserves its right to suspend the conclusion of the EEA Agreement as long as the ratification of the abovementioned bilateral agreements has not been notified to the Community by the EFTA States concerned. Moreover, the Community reserves its position as to the consequences to be drawn in case of non-ratification of these agreements.

DECLARATION

by the Governments of the EFTA States concerning the EFTA financial mechanism

The EFTA States consider that the 'appropriate and equitable solutions` referred to in the Joint Declaration concerning the financial mechanism should have the effect either that an EFTA State acceding to the Community should not be party to any financial obligation entered into by the EFTA financial mechanism after that State's accession to the Community or that a corresponding adjustment should be made to the contributions of that State to the EC general budget.

DECLARATION

by the Governments of the EFTA States concerning a court of first instance

The EFTA States will establish a court of first instance for cases in the field of competition, should the need arise.
