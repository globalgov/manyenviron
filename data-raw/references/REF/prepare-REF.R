# ref Preparation Script

# This is a template for importing, cleaning, and exporting data
# ready for the qPackage.

# Stage one: Collecting data
load("data-raw/references/REF/ecorefer.RData")

# Stage two: Correcting data
# In this stage you will want to correct the variable names and
# formats of the 'REF' object until the object created
# below (in stage three) passes all the tests.
REF <- purrr::discard(eco_refer, function(x) length(x)==1) %>%
  purrr::map(function(x){
    treatyrefs <- grepl("^TRE", x)
    if(sum(!treatyrefs)==1) paste(x[1], x[2], x[3:length(x)], sep = "_")
  } )

# Make REF a tibble
REF <- unlist(REF)
REF <- as_tibble(REF)

# Divide REF into three columns 
REF <- tidyr::separate(REF, value, into = c("Treaty1", "ReferenceType", "Treaty2"), sep = "_")

# Replace ECOLEX_ID by qID
ECOLEX <- qEnviron::agreements$ECOLEX
ECOLEX <- ECOLEX %>% 
  dplyr::select(ECOLEX_ID, qID)
  
ECOLEX <- as.data.frame(ECOLEX)
for (k in seq_len(nrow(ECOLEX))) {
  REF$Treaty1 <- gsub(paste0(ECOLEX$ECOLEX_ID[[k]]), paste0(ECOLEX$qID[[k]]), REF$Treaty1, ignore.case = TRUE, perl = T)
}
for (k in seq_len(nrow(ECOLEX))) {
  REF$Treaty2 <- gsub(paste0(ECOLEX$ECOLEX_ID[[k]]), paste0(ECOLEX$qID[[k]]), REF$Treaty2, ignore.case = TRUE, perl = T)
}

# Order the columns
REF <- REF %>% 
  dplyr::select(Treaty1, Treaty2, ReferenceType)

# qCreate includes several functions that should help cleaning
# and standardising your data.
# Please see the vignettes or website for more details.

# Stage three: Connecting data
# Next run the following line to make ref available
# within the qPackage.
qCreate::export_data(REF, database = "references", URL = "NA", package = "qEnviron")
# This function also does two additional things.
# First, it creates a set of tests for this object to ensure adherence
# to certain standards.You can hit Cmd-Shift-T (Mac) or Ctrl-Shift-T (Windows)
# to run these tests locally at any point.
# Any test failures should be pretty self-explanatory and may require
# you to return to stage two and further clean, standardise, or wrangle
#Â your data into the expected format.
# Second, it also creates a documentation file for you to fill in.
# Please make sure that you cite any sources appropriately and fill in as
# much detail about the variables etc as possible.
