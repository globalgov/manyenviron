# ref Preparation Script

# This is a template for importing, cleaning, and exporting data
# ready for the qPackage.

# Stage one: Collecting data
REF <- load("data-raw/references/ref/ecorefer.RData")

# Stage two: Correcting data
# In this stage you will want to correct the variable names and
# formats of the 'ref' object until the object created
# below (in stage three) passes all the tests.
REF <- as.data.frame(as.matrix(eco_refer)) %>% 
  dplyr::rename(References = V1)

REF <- as_tibble(REF)

REF$References <-gsub("c|\\(|\\)|\"", "", as.character(REF$References))
REF$References <-gsub("\\,", " ", as.character(REF$References))

# Replace ECOLEX_ID by qID
ECOLEX <- qEnviron::agreements$ECOLEX
ECOLEX <- ECOLEX %>% 
  dplyr::select(ECOLEX_ID, qID)
  
ECOLEX <- as.data.frame(ECOLEX)
for (k in seq_len(nrow(ECOLEX))) {
  REF$References <- gsub(paste0(ECOLEX$ECOLEX_ID[[k]]), paste0(ECOLEX$qID[[k]]), REF$References, ignore.case = TRUE, perl = T)
}

# qData includes several functions that should help cleaning
# and standardising your data.
# Please see the vignettes or website for more details.

# Stage three: Connecting data
# Next run the following line to make ref available
# within the qPackage.
qCreate::export_data(REF, database = "references", URL = "NA")
# This function also does two additional things.
# First, it creates a set of tests for this object to ensure adherence
# to certain standards.You can hit Cmd-Shift-T (Mac) or Ctrl-Shift-T (Windows)
# to run these tests locally at any point.
# Any test failures should be pretty self-explanatory and may require
# you to return to stage two and further clean, standardise, or wrangle
#Â your data into the expected format.
# Second, it also creates a documentation file for you to fill in.
# Please make sure that you cite any sources appropriately and fill in as
# much detail about the variables etc as possible.
