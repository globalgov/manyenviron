# qEnvironDev 0.0.2

Updated the agreements and memberships databases with new datasets and used the new version of the functions from qData which created new tests and R files.

## Data

* Imported initial datasets in qEnviron, cleaned them and export them in the databases.
  * Closed #2 by adding ECOLEX agreement data
  * Closed #3 by adding ECOLEX membership data
  * Closed #4 by adding GNEVAR agreement data 
  * Closed #5 by adding GNEVAR membership data
* Organized datasets in the two databases so the names are consistent
* Modified description file to add pointblank as dependency and precise authors' role
* Cleaned the datasets by making some long instead of wide and by standardizing the dates
